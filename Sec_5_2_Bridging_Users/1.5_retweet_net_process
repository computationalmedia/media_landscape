The global retweet network extracted by `1_global_retweet_net_extraction.py` needs to be further processed to use in the next. 
The process is similar to what has been done for within-country retweet network.

One need to call `3_retweet_net_merge.py`, `4_nodes_pred_succ.py`, `5_disparity_filter.py` and `6_prep_ls.py` to obtain 
labels.pickle and graph.pickle

For simplicitiy, these are all skipped here.
